# ha-blueprints #
Blueprints for use in Home Assistant.

## Usage ##
To include blueprints to your Home Assistant instance, simply download them and add them to their respective folder under `homeassisntant/config/blueprints`.

For example, include one like so: `homeassistant/config/blueprints/automation/thibstars/trigger_ifttt_webhook.yaml`.

After adding the blueprints, Home Assistant will normally load them automatically, making them ready to use.
